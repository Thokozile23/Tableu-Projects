## Key Objectives  

The primary goals of this analysis were to:  

- **Analyze Average Price Per Bedroom**: Understand how pricing varies based on the number of bedrooms.  

- **Count of Distinct Bedroom Listings**: Calculate the total number of unique listings based on the number of bedrooms.  

- **Map Price Per Zip Code**: Visualize the geographical distribution of property prices across Seattle by zip code.  

- **Analyze Average Price Per Zip Code**: Determine the average pricing trends in different zip code areas.  

- **Annual Revenue Generation**: Evaluate the revenue generated from listings on an annual basis.

## Data and Tools  

- **Data Source**: Seattle Open Airbnb Dataset (2016).  

- **Tool Used**: Tableau Desktop for data visualization and analysis.  

üéØ **Key Insights Uncovered**  

### **1. Pricing Trends**  
**Observation:**  
As the number of bedrooms in an Airbnb listing increases, the price tends to rise.  

**Why This May Be:**  
- **Perceived Value:** Listings with more bedrooms typically accommodate more guests, making them ideal for families or groups. This increases their perceived value, allowing hosts to charge higher prices.  

- **Luxury and Amenities:** Larger properties often come with additional amenities (e.g., larger living spaces, multiple bathrooms, or premium features) that justify a higher price.  

- **Target Audience:** Higher-priced listings with more bedrooms likely cater to travelers with greater spending capacity, such as vacationing families or corporate groups.  


### **2. Market Distribution**  

**Observation:**  
Price variations across Seattle zip codes highlight high-demand areas, particularly in the central part of the city.  

**Why This May Be:**  

- **Central Location:** Central Seattle areas are close to key attractions, business districts, and transportation hubs, making them more desirable for tourists and business travelers.  

- **High Demand, Limited Supply:** The central part of Seattle likely has a higher density of listings in premium neighborhoods, which increases prices due to competition.  

- **Proximity to Amenities:** These areas may offer easier access to popular restaurants, entertainment venues, and cultural landmarks, driving demand and justifying higher prices.  


### **3. Revenue Analysis**  

**Observation:**  

A yearly breakdown of revenue trends for 2016 reveals higher revenue generation in May, June, and December compared to other months.  

**Why This May Be:**  

- **Seasonal Travel Patterns:** May and June mark the beginning of the summer travel season, when more tourists visit Seattle for outdoor activities, festivals, and favorable weather.  

- **Holiday Demand:** December experiences an uptick due to holiday travel and events, such as Christmas and New Year's celebrations. Families and groups often book larger properties, driving up revenue.  

- **Local Events:** Seattle may host specific events or festivals during these months, such as the Seattle International Film Festival in May/June and winter holiday markets in December, contributing to the revenue spike.  

- **Business Travel:** Seattle is a hub for industries such as technology and aviation. Conferences and business travel may also increase bookings during certain months.  

### Summary:  

The pricing and revenue trends in the Airbnb project reflect both economic principles of supply and demand and the influence of external factors such as location desirability, seasonality, and the characteristics of the local market. By analyzing these insights, hosts can optimize their pricing strategies and identify opportunities to maximize revenue.
