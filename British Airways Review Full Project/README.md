**Description:** 

Analysis of monthly trends in overall ratings reveals fluctuations in passenger satisfaction:  
- February 2022 recorded the **highest overall rating of 6.9**, suggesting a period of strong performance or customer satisfaction.  
- Ratings significantly dropped to **1.0 in June 2020**, possibly due to disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced service quality, or operational challenges.  
- A recovery was observed in **August 2020**, with ratings peaking at 6.3, indicating a rebound in passenger satisfaction as operations normalized.  

**Recommendations:**

- **Russia:** Received a lower rating of **4.0**, suggesting dissatisfaction potentially caused by inconsistent service, cultural mismatches, or route-specific challenges.  

**Recommendations:**  

- **Leverage Strengths in High-Performing Regions:** Analyze what drives satisfaction in markets like Turkey (e.g., efficient service, tailored amenities) and replicate these practices.  
- **Target Low-Performing Regions:** For regions like Russia, conduct surveys or focus groups to identify specific pain points and implement localized solutions such as improved in-flight services or cultural adaptations.

- The **A321**, with only **3.6** across 36 reviews, lagged behind, possibly due to limited features, less comfortable seating, or operational inconsistencies.  

**Recommendations:**  

- **Promote High-Performing Aircraft:** Highlight the strengths of the Boeing 747-400 (e.g., comfort, reliability) in marketing and booking platforms to attract passengers.  
- **Upgrade Underperforming Models:** Identify specific shortcomings of the A321 (e.g., seat comfort or in-flight entertainment) and invest in upgrades or retrofitting to improve passenger experiences.
