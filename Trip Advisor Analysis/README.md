## **üîç Key Insights Explored:**

1. **Hotel Services Analysis:**  
   Explore which hotels offer additional amenities like free Wi-Fi, clubs, and basketball courts, and how these services influence their popularity. Only 4 hotels provide all four services.

**Recommendation**:

  Enhance Service Offerings: Given that only 4 hotels provide all four major services (free Wi-Fi, clubs, basketball courts, etc.), hotels that lack these services could 
  consider adding them to attract more guests. Amenities like these can significantly improve guest satisfaction and increase competitiveness, especially in the family and 
  business traveler segments.
  Promote Amenities: Hotels offering all four services should highlight this in their marketing campaigns to differentiate themselves in a competitive market.

2. **Global User Distribution:**  
     Examine the distribution of users across continents to understand the origins of visitors. North America accounts for the highest number of users, with a total of 295.

**Recommendation**:

  Focus on North American Markets: With North America contributing the highest number of users, hotels should continue to target this region through tailored marketing 
  strategies, partnerships with local travel agencies, and region-specific promotions.
  Expand Global Reach: Hotels with fewer users from other continents could explore new markets by offering region-specific deals or services to attract international guests, 
  particularly from underrepresented areas.

3. **Hotel Ratings by Stars:**  
   Gain an overview of how hotels are spread across different star ratings, shedding light on trends in both luxury and budget accommodations. Eight hotels received the 
   highest rating of 5 stars.

**Recommendation**:
  Maintain Quality for High Ratings: The 5-star hotels should continue to focus on providing top-tier services to maintain their high ratings. Regularly updating amenities 
  and ensuring excellent customer service can help sustain a reputation for luxury.
  Improvement for Budget Hotels: Hotels with lower star ratings may want to invest in incremental improvements, such as enhancing customer service or upgrading facilities, 
  to compete for a higher rating.


4. **Period of Stay Trends:**  
     Analyze booking patterns and the length of stays to identify peak periods. March to May shows a significant increase in stays, with 128 more compared to other months.

**Recommendation**:

  Optimize for Peak Periods: Hotels should consider adjusting pricing or offering exclusive promotions during the March-May period when bookings are higher. This will help 
  maximize revenue during peak seasons.
  Develop Off-Peak Strategies: For periods with lower bookings, consider offering discounts, special packages, or unique experiences to draw in more visitors.


5. **Traveler Type Segmentation:**  
     Identify the most common types of travelers‚Äîfamilies, couples, business, or solo visitors‚Äîand how this data can inform hotel marketing strategies. Couples are the 
     largest group, with 214 more than solo travelers, who make up only 24.

**Recommendation**:

  Target Couples: With a higher number of couples (214 more than solo travelers), hotels should consider offering couples-specific packages or experiences, such as romantic 
  getaways, couples' retreats, or special anniversary offers.
  Appeal to Solo Travelers: Since the number of solo travelers is lower, hotels could develop solo traveler-friendly programs or promotions, like discounted single rooms or 
  events tailored to solo guests (e.g., solo dining experiences, meetups).


6. **Top 10 Hotels by Room Count:**  
     Examine the largest hotels in Las Vegas by total room count to gauge the scale of operations. The Venetian Las Vegas Hotel leads, with an average room count of 4,000.

**Recommendation**:
  Leverage Large Properties for Events: Hotels with a large number of rooms, like The Venetian Las Vegas Hotel, should explore hosting large-scale events such as 
  conventions, weddings, and conferences to optimize room occupancy.
  Optimize Room Usage in Smaller Hotels: For smaller hotels, improving occupancy rates and offering personalized services can help maximize profitability, such as creating 
  a more intimate guest experience or focusing on niche markets (e.g., boutique stays, luxury suites).



## **üìà Why This Project Stands Out**  

   This analysis goes beyond just looking at hotel ratings‚Äîit dives deep into how services, user demographics, and hotel attributes interact to define the Las Vegas hotel 
   landscape. The **Trip Advisor** dashboard offers hotel managers, marketers, and travelers a wealth of insights to make data-driven decisions, whether it‚Äôs targeting 
   specific traveler types, optimizing amenities, or forecasting demand.
